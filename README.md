# Poetry Dad

A school assignment to create a useless site. Although, if you like dad jokes it might not be so useless.

# Code Review

1. `Instead of one big file for you styling you could brake it down into smaller files that would make it easier to read and find a specific styling.`
2. `Good names for your classes, it's easy to understand the purpose of them`
3. `The comments are well written which makes it easy to understand what the function do.`
4. `You have name two of the js file after there function but the last one is named app.js. Why not name it the same way, by it's function? That would make it easier to know what is in the file and you would have written all your file names the same way.`.
5. `There are three files in your audio folder but I cant find where you use the file hardkey.mp3` 

Even though the page is pretty useless, it did make me laugh out loud!
